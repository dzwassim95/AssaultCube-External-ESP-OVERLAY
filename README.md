- So this is a simpl esp overlay hack for version `1.3.0.2` .  
- I made sure the overlay window keeps synced with the game window, that means you can move or resize the game window to whatever you want , and it will not affect the esp ! .
- You need to include `ImGui` and `d3d11.lib` to the project . 
- just run the `esp.exe` that's it ! .
